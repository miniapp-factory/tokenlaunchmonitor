#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a stylized rocket launching upward, with a sleek, modern design. The rocket is centered, with a gradient of blue and green colors, and a subtle glow effect around it. The background is a light gray gradient, giving a clean and professional look. The logo should convey innovation, speed, and the excitement of new token launches, with a minimalistic style and no text.
